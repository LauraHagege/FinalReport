DICOM file format is a special software integrated standard format dedicated to ease data communication within different facilities in the Medical Imaging Field. This standard has been defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manifactural Association (NEMA) in 1983. DICOM format defines data dictionnary, data structure, file format and comes with a TCP/IP protocole to facilitate data transfer among a lot of other features. Before this standard was created it was difficult for different facilities to exchange imaging and imformation, now this format is widely use for all medical imaging areas such as CT (Computed Tomography), MRI (Magnetic Reasonance Imaging), X-Rays, Ultrasounds, etc.
