What I want to tell:

1. Why I choose dcmtk: 
 obviously I coudln't unwrap dicom element by myself
 dcmtk provided me a way to access tag element easily
 sound's widely used on the internet --> lot's of prebuild readers were using dcmtk

2. Building dcmtk:
 issues 
 solutions --> explain how to link 
 
 
3. Dcmtk classes 

As I said DCMTK provides well-formed classes

had to go through dcmtk documentation to find the relevant function I will use ! 

Dcmtk provides a lot a classes to deal with dicom format 


Developp the one I used:

- DicomImages
- Dealing with tag element -> file and get bordel
- DICOM bordel going though the tree
