The first challenge of this project was to render a set of DICOM Images or at least one DICOM Image. 

As I already explained, in part 4.4, the DICOM folder tree structure blablabla 


However IMG0000 file are not of only one type, this file can be either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One single frame DICOM Image
	\item Several single frame DICOM Images
	\item One multiframe DICOM Image
\end{itemize}

Objectively, single and multi frame images only differ by the size of the file.

\textbf{1. Display one image:}

The DCMTK library that I installed contains several classes that should make DICOM Images treatment easier.
The class I used to deal with DICOM Images files is called DicomImage, the class structure and related functions are available on DCMTK website [8888].
The class is provided with four different constructors and depending on the given parameters this class allows to deal with single frame and multiframe images. Information about the constructor I choosed are available on Appendix XXX figure YYY


\begin{itemize}
	\item Display single frame DICOM Image:
	
	\begin{center}
	\textit{DicomImage *DcmImg = new DicomImage(path)}
	\end{center}
	
	
	\item Display multiframe DICOM Image:
	
	\begin{center}
	\textit{DicomImage *DcmImg = new DicomImage(path,0,index,1)}
	\end{center}
	
	\textit{index} being the index of the frame to display
	
\end{itemize}

The variable \textit{path} is a string and contains the absolut path to the DICOM Image file.

Once I got the DicomImage object, I need to get the pixels in order to have the opportunity to use QImage class thereafter. Here again DCMTK provide me with the function \textit{getOutputData()} - see Appendix XX figure ZZ -. The corresponding line of code is:
\newline \vspace{5mm} 

	\begin{center}
	\textit{uint8_t* pixelData= DcmImg->getOutputData(8)}
	\end{center}

\newline \vspace{5mm}  
Explain what is uint8_t



Finally I only need to use two classes provided by Qt to render the DICOM Image on my application:

\newline \vspace{5mm} 

	\begin{center}
	\textit{uint8_t* pixelData= DcmImg->getOutputData(8)}
	\end{center}

\newline \vspace{5mm}  

QIMage only takes pixel and a scene can only display QPixmap element see appendix

\textbf{2. Store and display successive images of the serie}
