According to a study published in January 2018 from \textbf{National Health Service (NHS) England} [2], 41.4 million \textbf{imaging tests} have been reported in England between October 2016 and December 2017. Indeed, \textbf{medical imaging} exams are routinely used all over the world to explore internal body structures and/or diagnose diseases. This generic term encompasses various clinical imaging techniques, such as, \textbf{Magnetic Resonance Imaging} (MRI), \textbf{Computerized Tomography} (CT-Scan) or \textbf{X-Ray}, which produce a 2D or 3D representation of physical internal structures.

Methods used for those exams are common, and since the introduction of the \textbf{DICOM standard} in 1985 [3], so is the professional storage and communication system. However, when it comes to sharing diagnoses with patient, each country has developed its own methods. In the \textbf{United Kingdom}, it is uncommon that a patient gets, or even requests, access to its medical data. On demand, and providing payment, one can get his data, but, generally, patients have only access to their clinical report, by means of a general practitioner, and the medical images, themselves are never seen by the patient.

Simultaneously, with the evolution of technology continually improving access to data; access to \textbf{medical information}, including imaging data, has become more commonplace . However, the issue about sharing those sensitive data, is not only to promote access, but essentially to make those images understandable for non clinicians. Research has already been undertaken in the United States concerning the creation of a \textbf{``patient portal"} [4] - fully designed to facilitate \textbf{patient understanding} - exploring the related opportunities, and scaling different levels of benefit.

Considering those facts, \textbf{Dr Fernando Bello} and \textbf{Pr William Cox} have decided to deepen the subject of designing a \textbf{patient portal}. First, by exploring the \textbf{benefits and risks} of sharing medical information with patients, and thereafter by effectively building such an interface. Consequently, after a year of background researches, they offered to work on the creation of \textbf{``A digital interface designed for sharing diagnostic medical imaging with patients"}, as a final personal project to the \textbf{department of Computing Science at Imperial College of London}, together with the \textbf{Chelsea and Westminster Hospital}. Aiming to build an interface \textbf{suitably made for imaging patients} in order to let them access and understand their medical results in the most significant and comprehensible way.

The following report contains an overview of the work undertaken during almost three month beginning mid May 2018 under the supervision of \textbf{Dr Fernando Bello} and \textbf{Pr William Cox}. The following sections will develop in a logical order - for better understanding - the several steps reached during the conception of the interface, including issues, skills earned and personal review.
