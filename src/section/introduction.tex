"This is one of the most important components of the report. It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by the reader. It should summarise everything you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background and relevance to other work, and give pointers to the remaining sections of the report that contain the bulk of the technical material."
