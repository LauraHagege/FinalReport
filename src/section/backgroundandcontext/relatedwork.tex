Before we started to actually discuss about the project, William provided me with several documents being either litterature reviews or articles (mentioned above) concerning works and researches directly related to the project. Among this he also provided me with the late stage report of his PhD containing the state of play of his work back then. Those papers have allow me to understand the background of the project and to identify the related issues and challenges.

The goal of Will's PhD is to identify the risks and benefits related to the creation of a patient-oriented interface. To be more precise I would cite directly from this report:

\textit{"Intuitively, there are benefits available from sharing images with patients. Indeed, there is a wealth of research available which assesses how visualisation aids increased understanding, or promotes communication. However, little research assesses the value of radiological images in this context. Moreover, no work assesses the risks associated with sharing patients’ images with them.This is the gap which this PhD will address. The research questions for this PhD are, therefore:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Is there additional benefit that can be extracted from diagnostic images?
	\item If so, what are the requirements to enable the realisation of this benefit?"
\end{itemize}}

\newline \vspace{5mm}
Specifically, benefits are divied in two categories:
\textit{
\begin{itemize}
	\item "Primary benefits – benefits related to the rationale for acquiring the image, e.g. diagnosis, assessment, interventional guidance
	\item Secondary benefits – benefits unrelated to the rationale for acquiring the image, e.g. education, communication, empowerment""
\end{itemize}
}

At the moment, Will did a significant work on literatture review to set up the background and understand the issues related to the creation of a patient portal, I would cite "to ensure that this was a suitable subject for research and to identify any pertinent gaps in the existing knowledge.".  He also carried out a survey, supplemented with 8 semi-structured interviews in order identify and scale the related risks and benefits. Results of those experience are available for consultation on Appendix 1. In the future the plan in to interview patient on the same model as clinician to evaluate the general opinion.
