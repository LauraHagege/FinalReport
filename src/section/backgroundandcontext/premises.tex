Providing medical data to a patient is always a delicate step in a medical procedure. According to medical imaging, there are 2 manners to share data with patient, either under the control of a clinical expert, or recently via standalone technologies which could left the patient with some doubts.  

While sharing this data on a digital interface > benefit tot. discuss
Subject of will pHD, define in its report + litterature review, a lot of article 

Before beginig to work --> read though those paper and understand the challenges of this project and why 


Challenges to create an interface that could be sufficiant or provide enough to guide on the right track



PATIENT PORTAL = view medical report online 
PORTAL CAN BE "DYNAMIC AND TAILORED to patient information preference"  IPAD 2

creating an interface that can be progressively adapted in order to fit patient needs.

Why the project: 

Medical Imaging exams are routinely used to explore the human body and detect disease. 

In the litterature: experience and perceive patient needs in terms of information sharing 
--> IPAD2 = making a study on the benefit of sharing information with patient, how to share, what to share, how will patients reacts - focusedd on lung cancer patient (Los angeles)

A LOOOOOt of litterature in this field, a lot of background work on the benefit, my work come as the final stage of this question

2 BENEFIT: related and unrelated (education etc)

WILL PHD --> explore/ quantify the benefit --> MY WORK: SET UP his work in order to test it 

Some sample patient portal already done 

There are plenty of interface to deal with medical imaging but they are all made for doctors. 


With this project we want to make something accessible for the patient and valuable for them --> will levels of benefit 


With concern to provide patient with some "right" information and don't let them look over the internet for wrong answers
-> examples and talking with doctors
