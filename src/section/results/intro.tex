As specified at the begining of this report, the main goal of my project was to build a Graphical User Interface, suitably made for medical imaging patient in order to help them view their medical images. The final result of my project consist consequently in a Windows runnable application, that can be used by anyone, in order to view imaging data. The following section will present the finale output of the interface in terms of content and features. The first part intend to give a general overview of the interface, describing the different steps from the launching of the app to the effective display of one medical image. The second part will focus more precicesly on the features that I have developped and are available through the interface.
