A lot of tools are available on the Internet to manage the creation of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). These kinds of software provide classes, function and usually a ``designer" mode to facilitate the creation of an interface. The most famous I discovered on the Internet are Qt, WxWidget, GTK+, FLTK, FOX. If necessary, I would have been ready to learn any programming language to achieve my project, luckily for me most of the available tools are develop in C++. During this year of Computing Science master at Imperial College of London I learned a lot on the C++ languages, firstly through lectures and lab session, and also through my group project. Hence, it was really time saving for me not to look for other tools.

In order to be sure to use a widget library that will suit me I have decided to compare the provided one before picking one. I couldn't compare all of them, so I have decided to focus on Qt, WxWidget GTK+.I looked across the Internet to get some testimonies about the different tools and I tried to distinguish them following several criteria - see grid below. According to these criteria and considering that Qt is highly recommended for beginners, I have finally decided to use Qt for this project.

In order to get used to Qt, which was new to me, I have decided to complete Openclassroom tutorials [6]. Those tutorials have helped me to install QtCreator and to get familiar with Qt beginning with some basic exercices.
