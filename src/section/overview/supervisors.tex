My direct supervisor is Dr Fernando Bello, he is a computer scientist and engineer working at the intersection of medicine, education and technology. He is a Reader in Surgical Computing and Simulation Science at Imperial College London, where he co-directs the Centre for Engagement and Simulation Science, leading a multi-disciplinary research group aiming at building suitable models and simulations of clinical processes, including clinical examination, clinical diagnosis, interventional procedures and care pathways.
Dr Bello proposed my project as entitled "An intelligent digital interface for sharing diagnostic medical imaging with patients".\\

I am also working with William Cox, which is currently working on a PhD project investigating the extraction of novel benefit from diagnostic radiological images through sharing images with patients.\\ 

Dr Bello and Mr Cox will be together supporting my project and providing me informations, feed-back and support for its realization. \\
