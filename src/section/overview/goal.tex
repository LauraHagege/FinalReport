The aim of this project is to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows MRI, CT-scan, X-Ray patients to access their datas, with different levels of “benefits”. Data acquisition through this interface should be valuable for patients. \\
Following the first meeting with my tutors I have been able to define main criteria of success concerning the creation of the interface:
\begin{itemize}
\item Patient should be able to understand provided images 
\item Patient could explore the data in different ways/ different images orientation
\item Patient should have the possibility to ask questions to doctors/ specific assigned people
\end{itemize}
I have used those basis criteria to create further specifications to meet my supervisors needs.\\

Some tools are already existing but essentially for dorctors; my tutors are expecting me to create something similar to the existing available interfaces but in a version that is understandable/usable for a non clinical person. The idea is to look at existing interface designs and consider how they could be changed in order to make them user friendly for the specified user group more accessible/intuitive.
